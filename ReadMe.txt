# Inverted-Pendulum-Simulink
This is Simulation of Inverted Pendulum Sytem in MATLAB Simulink

TO RUN SIMULATION, FIRST:
1. open Init_Setup_LQRArd.m file in MATLAB and RUN it
2. this will calculate gains & initilize all parameters 
3. To Simulate Swing Up & LQR Control RUN IP_SwingUp_Design.slx file in Simulink.
4. For 3d Animation Visualization go to IP_SwingUp_Design/3D Animation block and click on VR Sink Block.
